Hey! I'm Vandam, a 21 year old software engineer based in Bristol, UK. I'm currently working at Dyson, solving robotic-simulation-esque problems along with some MyDyson cloud stuff too. 

I'll be returning to Bristol Uni in September for my fourth year of study in Engineering Mathematics.

# What I'm focusing on right now
1. Completing my internship at Dyson
2. Attaining V4 on 2024 Moonboard
3. Reading
