Hey there! 👋🏻

My name is Vandam and I'm a second year undergrad studying [Engineering Mathematics (MEng)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2023/engineering-maths/meng-eng-maths) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk).

I'm having a blast learning all things Software Engineering, Data Science, ML, AI and Privacy related.

On this website, I'll be posting thoughts, guides and try to convince you to give John Mayer a try. 

I also have a newsletter where I write about music, [Interlude](https://intl.substack.com).
