This cover came together in an evening during my first year of university. It was one of those nights where I felt so inspired and motivated. I love how short and sweet it is.

The original song is by Charlie Burg. You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/5HKv1sFHbXgmXBih203HxT).
